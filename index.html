            <p><h4>Software Engineer with a passion for building clean, efficient, and scalable solutions. With a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in full-stack development, I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant code and intuitive user experiences.

                 I specialize in technologies like JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and have experience working with cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. I follow agile methodologies and value writing maintainable code, continuous learning, and effective collaboration.

                Over the years, I’ve contributed to a variety of projects—from developing web applications and APIs to designing cloud-native systems that serve thousands of users. Whether it's building something from scratch or improving an existing system, I’m always excited to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.

                When I’m not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, learning about new tech trends, and occasionally mentoring aspiring developers.

                Let’s connect and build something great together!</h4>
